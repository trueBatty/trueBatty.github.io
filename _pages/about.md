👋Welcome to my homepage! I am an incoming PhD student at Sun Yat-Sen University, starting in the fall of 2025.
Currently, I am a third-year master's student at SUDA NLP Lab, School of Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University, under the supervision of [Prof. Shoushan Li](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=ZRGSxdUAAAAJ). 
Additionally, I was a research intern at the [Provable Responsible AI and Data Analytics (PRADA) Lab](https://pradalab1.github.io/), KAUST, advised by [Prof. Di Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5hGRe_QAAAAJ). 

My research interests fall in the fields of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), including Agent Evolution, Reasoning Capabilities, and Reward Modeling.
