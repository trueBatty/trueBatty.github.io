## 👋 About Me
Welcome to my homepage! I am an incoming PhD student at Sun Yat-Sen University, starting in the fall of 2025.
Currently, I am a third-year master's student at SUDA NLP Lab, School of Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University, under the supervision of <u>[Prof. Shoushan Li](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=ZRGSxdUAAAAJ)</u>. 
Additionally, I was a research intern at <u>[PRADA Lab](https://pradalab1.github.io/)</u>, KAUST, advised by <u>[Prof. Di Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5hGRe_QAAAAJ)</u>. 


My research interests fall in the fields of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), including Agent Evolution, Reasoning Capabilities, and Reward Modeling.
