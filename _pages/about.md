👋Welcome to my homepage! I am an incoming Ph.D. student at DiLab, Sun Yat-Sen University, advised by [Assoc. Prof. Sheng Yue](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mc_MN_MAAAAJ). 
I received my master's degree at NLP Lab, Soochow University, advised by [Prof. Shoushan Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZRGSxdUAAAAJ). 
Before that, I received my bachelor’s degree at Heilongjiang Institute of Technology, advised by [Prof. Haoliang Qi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R6Ouo-cAAAAJ) and [Prof. Zhongyuan Han](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mep07fMAAAAJ).

My research interests fall in the fields of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), including Agent Evolution, Reasoning Capabilities, and Reward Modeling. 
The ultimate goal of my research is to build systems that can self-evolve to achieve superhuman intelligence.
